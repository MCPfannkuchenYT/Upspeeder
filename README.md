# VideoSpeeder
 Speeds up your Video in notime!

# How to use
You download it and start it with java 8 (you probably have java 8)
It will automatically download ffmpeg to AppData.

Select a Video File on the left.

Change the Tickrate accordingly and maybe change the Bitrate. (0-5000 small, 5000-15000 my prefer, 15000-50000 peak quality)

And finally click Start on the right.
